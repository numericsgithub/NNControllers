- run the create_coeff.py
- run the create_scripts.py in the expiriments/ folder (Choose old or new method there. The old one is the original from the paper. Later I found out that with more optimization of the code and by removing memory leaks results get better with a much much bigger batch size...)
- run the all_experiments.sh in the expiriments/ folder
- run the create_plots.py to see results
